### **Hi there** 👋

**Pablo** is an **aerospace engineer** (currently working on my **Computer Vision Master's Thesis**) who is curious about the SW world. 

Here you could find some projects he has worked on:

## **Computer Vision**

- [TreeDetector](https://github.com/PabloAsensio/AIVA_2021-imagenes_aereas). [Python](*Spanish wiki only*). Here you could find a simulation between a client (teacher) and the business (us). Where client give us some specifications for success.
- [Biometrics stuffs](https://github.com/PabloAsensio/MUVA-biometria). [Python](*No wiki*). Fingerprint Minutae and Spoofing Attack works can be finded here.
- [3D Vision exercises](https://github.com/PabloAsensio/MUVA-vision-tridimensional-practicas) [Python; JupyterNotebook] (*Spanish wiki only*). Some 3D vision exercises.

### Relationated with Pablo's Master Thesis

**Pablo** is going to **research** if it is possible for **drones** to make **3D indoors maps** using **SLAM** algorithms. As well, he will create an exercise on [RoboticsAcademy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/) and [Unibotics](https://unibotics.org/)

- [Vio-SDSlam](https://github.com/PabloAsensio/SDslam/tree/vio-sdslam). [C++] Algorithm which will be implemented on the drone.
- [RoboticsAcademy](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy). [Python] Repo of *RoboticsAcademy and Unibotics*

## **Aerospace Engineering**

- [Air Traffic Simulator](https://github.com/PabloAsensio/ATCSim). [C++] We could find an **30 people project***. This was the first "big" project participated on.*(Does not appear on mean repo).
- [Real Time ILS Calibration](https://github.com/PabloAsensio/ILS_Calibration). [C++ and Python] (*No wiki yet. Code may be incomplete.*). He's final degree work, also he's first real time application. This app could run on a Raspberry Pi (No tested).
- [IMU and GNSS integration. Kalman Filter.](https://github.com/PabloAsensio/Integracion-IMU-GNSS) [Matlab] (*Spanish PDF only*). You can see here how an Inertial Measurement Unit works. We used a GNSS receptor to make corrections using a Kalman Filter.
